                paragraph1="Learn how to design effective error responses and use appropriate HTTP
                    status codes in your .NET Web API for improved communication and debugging."
                paragraph2="When building APIs, providing clear and consistent error responses is essential for a good developer
                    and user experience. Proper error handling not only helps you communicate issues to your users but

                <h2>Why Error Responses and Status Codes Matter</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consistent Communication: APIs that use standardized error responses help clients quickly
                        understand and react to issues.</li>
                    <li>Improved Debugging: Well-designed error responses provide developers with the information
                        they need to troubleshoot problems effectively.</li>
                    <li>Client Expectations: Using the correct HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for "Not Found" or 500
                        for "Internal Server Error") helps manage client expectations and conveys the nature of the
                        issue.</li>

                <h2>Step 1: Understanding HTTP Status Codes</h2>
                <p>HTTP status codes are grouped into five categories that reflect the outcome of the request:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>1xx (Informational):</strong> These are rarely used in APIs and indicate that the
                        request is being processed.</li>
                    <li><strong>2xx (Success):</strong> These indicate that the request was successful.
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>200 OK:</code> The request was successful, and the response contains the
                                requested data.</li>
                            <li><code>201 Created:</code> The request was successful, and a new resource was created
                                (often used with POST).</li>
                            <li><code>204 No Content:</code> The request was successful, but there is no content to
                                return (commonly used with DELETE requests).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>3xx (Redirection):</strong> These indicate that the client must take additional
                        actions to complete the request.</li>
                    <li><strong>4xx (Client Error):</strong> These indicate that there was an issue with the
                        clientâ€™s request.
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>400 Bad Request:</code> The server could not understand the request due to
                                invalid syntax.</li>
                            <li><code>401 Unauthorized:</code> The request lacks valid credentials.</li>
                            <li><code>403 Forbidden:</code> The server understands the request, but the client is
                                not authorized to perform the action.</li>
                            <li><code>404 Not Found:</code> The requested resource could not be found.</li>
                            <li><code>422 Unprocessable Entity:</code> The request is well-formed but contains
                                semantic errors.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>5xx (Server Error):</strong> These indicate that the server encountered an error and
                        could not fulfill the request.
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>500 Internal Server Error:</code> A generic error when the server fails to
                                process the request.</li>
                            <li><code>502 Bad Gateway:</code> The server is acting as a gateway and received an
                                invalid response from an upstream server.</li>
                            <li><code>503 Service Unavailable:</code> The server is temporarily unavailable (e.g.,
                                maintenance or overload).</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2>Step 2: Designing Effective Error Responses</h2>
                <p>An effective error response should provide enough information to understand the nature of the
                    problem while avoiding exposing sensitive internal details. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTTP Status Code:</strong> The status code communicates the outcome of the request.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Error Code:</strong> A unique, human-readable error code that allows clients to
                        programmatically identify the error type.</li>
                    <li><strong>Message:</strong> A description of the error that helps clients understand what went
                        wrong.</li>
                    <li><strong>Details (Optional):</strong> Additional information or context (like validation
                        error details or the field causing the issue).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Example Error Response Structure:</p>
                <CodeSnippet language="json" code={`{
    "error": 
    {
        "code": "invalid_input",
        "message": "The input data is invalid.",
        "details": 
        [
            {
                "field": "email",
                "message": "Email address is required."
            },
            {
                "field": "password",
                "message": "Password must be at least 8 characters."
            }
        ]
    }
}`} />
                <br></br>
                <p>This structure includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>error.code:</strong> A machine-readable error code that can be used by clients to
                        handle specific
                        errors programmatically.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>error.message:</strong> A human-readable description of the error.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>error.details:</strong> (Optional) More specific error details, like validation
                        messages for fields.
                    </li>

                <h2>Step 3: Implementing Error Responses in .NET</h2>
                <p>Now that we understand the structure of an effective error response, let's look at how to
                    implement this in a .NET Web API.</p>
                <h3>Example 1: Handling Client Errors (e.g., 400 Bad Request)</h3>
                <CodeSnippet language="csharp" code={`public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult CreateProduct([FromBody] Product product)
    {
        if (product == null)
        {
            return BadRequest(new
        {       
            error = new
                {
                    code = "invalid_input",
                    message = "Product data is required."
                }
            });
        }

        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(product.Name))
        {
            return BadRequest(new
            {
                error = new
                    {
                        code = "missing_field",
                        message = "The product name is required.",
                        details = new []
                    {
                        new { field = "name", message = "Product name cannot be empty." }
                    }
                }
            });
        }

        // Proceed with the product creation logic
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetProduct), new {id = product.Id}, product);
    }
}`} />
                <br></br>
                <p>In this example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the product parameter is null, a 400 Bad Request error is returned with a message
                        indicating the required data.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the product.Name is missing, the error response includes a missing_field code and
                        provides validation details.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Example 2: Handling Unauthorized Access (e.g., 401 Unauthorized)</h3>
                <CodeSnippet language="csharp" code={`public class AuthenticationController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost("login")]
    public IActionResult Login([FromBody] LoginRequest request)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(request.Username) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(request.Password))
        {
            return Unauthorized(new
            {
                error = new
                {
                    code = "invalid_credentials",
                    message = "Invalid username or password."
                }
            });
        }

        // Authentication logic...
        return Ok(new { message = "Login successful" });
    }
}`} />
                <br></br>
                <p>Here, we use the 401 Unauthorized status code to indicate that the client provided invalid
                    credentials.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Example 3: Handling Not Found Errors (e.g., 404 Not Found)</h3>
                <CodeSnippet language="csharp" code={`public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IProductService _productService;

    public ProductsController(IProductService productService)
    {
        _productService = productService;
    }

    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public IActionResult GetProduct(int id)
    {
        var product = _productService.GetProductById(id);
        if (product == null)
        {
            return NotFound(new
            {
                error = new
                {
                    code = "not_found",
                    message = $"Product with ID {id} was not found."
                }
            });
        }

        return Ok(product);
    }
}`} />
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    In this case, a 404 Not Found error is returned when a product with the specified id is not
                    found in the system.
                </p>
            </Section>

            <Section>
                <h2>Step 4: Handling Server Errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error)</h2>
                <p>If your API encounters an unexpected issue, a 500 Internal Server Error should be returned. This
                    can be handled centrally using custom middleware for error logging and graceful error handling.
                </p>
                <h3>Example: Custom Error Handling Middleware</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Test Client-Side Errors: Try sending malformed requests (e.g., missing required fields) and
                        check that the 400 Bad Request error is returned with the appropriate message.</li>
                    <li>Test Authentication Errors: Attempt accessing protected resources with invalid credentials
                        to ensure a 401 Unauthorized response is returned.</li>
                    <li>Test Resource Not Found: Try accessing non-existent resources and check that the 404 Not
                        Found error is returned.</li>
                    <li>Test Server Errors: Simulate a server error (e.g., by throwing an exception) and confirm
                        that a 500 Internal Server Error is returned.</li>
