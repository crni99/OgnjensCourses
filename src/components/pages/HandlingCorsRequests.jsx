                    Communication in .NET"
                paragraph1="Learn how to handle cross-origin requests securely in your .NET Web API,
                    allowing communication with external domains while maintaining security."
                paragraph2="In modern web applications, it's common for the frontend and backend to be hosted on different
                    domains or ports. This scenario introduces a security concept known as Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
                    (CORS). When a client-side application (like a web app) hosted on one domain makes a request to an
                    API hosted on another, the browser enforces the Same-Origin Policy to prevent cross-site scripting
                    attacks. CORS is the mechanism that allows web applications to securely make requests to APIs hosted
                    on different domains."
