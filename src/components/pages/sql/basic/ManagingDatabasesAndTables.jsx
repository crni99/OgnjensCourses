                <h2>Creating and Deleting Databases</h2>
                <p>In SQL, databases are the container for all your tables, views, and data. Creating and deleting databases is a fundamental part of database management.</p>

                <h3>1. Creating a Database</h3>
                <p>To create a new database, you can use the <strong>CREATE DATABASE</strong> statement:</p>
                <CodeSnippet language="sql" code={`CREATE DATABASE company_db;`} />
                
                <p>This SQL query will create a new database named <code>company_db</code>.</p>

                <h3>2. Deleting a Database</h3>
                <p>If you need to delete a database, you can use the <strong>DROP DATABASE</strong> statement. Be very cautious, as this will permanently delete the entire database and its contents:</p>
                <CodeSnippet language="sql" code={`DROP DATABASE company_db;`} />
                
                <p>This query will permanently delete the <code>company_db</code> database. Make sure to backup data if necessary before performing this action.</p>
            </Section>

            <Section>
                <h2>Creating and Deleting Tables</h2>
                <p>Once youâ€™ve created a database, you can create tables within it. Tables hold the actual data in rows and columns. SQL also allows you to delete tables if needed.</p>

                <h3>1. Creating a Table</h3>
                <p>To create a table, you use the <strong>CREATE TABLE</strong> statement. Below is an example of creating an <code>employees</code> table:</p>
                <CodeSnippet language="sql" code={`CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  position VARCHAR(100),
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);`} />
                
                <p>This SQL query creates a table called <code>employees</code> with columns for <code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>position</code>, and <code>salary</code>. Each column has a specific data type, which is explained in the next section.</p>

                <h3>2. Deleting a Table</h3>
                <p>If you need to delete a table, you can use the <strong>DROP TABLE</strong> statement. Keep in mind that this will delete the table and all its data permanently:</p>
                <CodeSnippet language="sql" code={`DROP TABLE employees;`} />
                
                <p>This command will delete the <code>employees</code> table and all the data inside it.</p>
            </Section>

            <Section>
                <h2>Basic Data Types in SQL</h2>
                <p>When creating tables, you define the type of data each column can hold. SQL supports a variety of data types to store different kinds of information.</p>

                <h3>1. Integer Data Types</h3>
                <p>For whole numbers, SQL uses <strong>INT</strong> or <strong>INTEGER</strong> data types. These are used for storing numerical data without decimals.</p>
                <CodeSnippet language="sql" code={`id INT PRIMARY KEY;`} />
                
                <p>The <code>id</code> column in the <code>employees</code> table is an integer type, meaning it can store whole numbers.</p>

                <h3>2. String Data Types</h3>
                <p>String data types are used to store text. The most commonly used string data type is <strong>VARCHAR</strong>, which allows you to store variable-length strings. You specify a maximum length for the string.</p>
                <CodeSnippet language="sql" code={`name VARCHAR(100);`} />
                
                <p>This <code>name</code> column in the table can store text data up to 100 characters in length.</p>

                <h3>3. Decimal Data Types</h3>
                <p>For numbers with decimals (e.g., for salary, prices), SQL uses <strong>DECIMAL</strong> or <strong>NUMERIC</strong> data types. These data types allow you to define the total number of digits and the number of decimal places.</p>
                <CodeSnippet language="sql" code={`salary DECIMAL(10, 2);`} />
                
                <p>The <code>salary</code> column can store a number with up to 10 digits, two of which can be after the decimal point (e.g., 99999999.99).</p>

                <h3>4. Date and Time Data Types</h3>
                <p>For storing dates and times, SQL provides data types like <strong>DATE</strong> and <strong>DATETIME</strong>.</p>
                <CodeSnippet language="sql" code={`hire_date DATE;`} />
                
                <p>The <code>hire_date</code> column would store the date when an employee was hired.</p>

                <h3>5. Other Data Types</h3>
                <p>There are additional data types in SQL for storing boolean values, binary data, and more. Some common ones include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>BOOLEAN</strong> - Stores <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> values.</li>
                    <li><strong>BLOB</strong> - Used for binary large objects, such as images or files.</li>
                    <li><strong>TEXT</strong> - Used to store long text values.</li>
                </ul>
